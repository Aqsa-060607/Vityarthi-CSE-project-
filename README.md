         PASSWORD GENERATOR
## Overview Of The Project
The PASSWORD GENERATOR is a python based program designed to create strong, secure, and fully random passwords. It allows users to specify the desired password length, and the program generates a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to maximize password strength.

This project is useful for students, developers, and anyone who needs to create safe passwords for online accounts, applications, or secure data storage.

It demonstrates fundamental python concepts such as randomization , strings, loops, functions, and user interaction.
## Features
1.	Generates fully random passwords
2.	User can choose custom password length
3.	Includes uppercase, lowercase , digits, and symbols
4.	Prevents too-short or weak passwords
5.	Easy to use (simple input  instant output
6.	Lightweight and runs on any system with python installed
## 	Technologies / Tools used
. Programming Language: Python 

. Libraries:
	 random – for random character selection
	  String – for character sets (letters, digits, punctuation)

.Environment: 
## 	Steps to Install & Run the Project
1.	Clone the repository: git clone
2.	Ensure python is installed on your system
3.	Install random and also install string
