## Problem statement
With the increasing number of online accounts, applications, and digital services, users often struggle to create strong and unique passwords. Many people reuse simple passwords, making their accounts vulnerable to hacking, brute-force att ##Problem statement
More online accounts, apps and services make it hard for the people to create passwords. I see many people reuse passwords. The simple passwords leave the accounts open. The simple passwords leave the accounts open, to hacking to force attacks and to data breaches. That is a risk.
I see a need, for the tool that can instantly generate passwords. The passwords must follow security standards. The passwords must lower the risk of access.
## Scope of the Project

a) The Password Generator is a Python tool. I use the Password Generator to make passwords. The Password Generator lets you set the length you need.
The scope covers the items listed below:

b) Generating random passwords using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

c) I think the users can set the password length. The users need to be able to choose the length the users want.

d) Producing passwords suitable for multiple use cases like websites, applications, Wi-Fi networks, or personal data protection.

e) I am building a command line tool. The command line tool works on any device that has Python installed.


I am building the project. The project focuses on simplicity, reliability and strong randomness. The project does not use UI or encryption systems.
## Target Users

We made this project for:

1) Students needing secure passwords for academic platforms or coding projects

2) I have seen that General users want passwords to log in. General users need passwords, for the accounts.

3) I have seen developers need the password generation, for testing. I also see developers need the password generation, for configurations.

4) I see that IT users need passwords, for the system setups. IT users rely on those passwords.

5) Anyone concerned about digital security and password strength
## High-Level Features

1) Random Password Generation: Random Password Generation gives me a password that's random and unpredictable.

2) Customizable Length: The user can set the password length. The user decides how characters the password will contain.

3) Strong Character Mix: I use Strong Character Mix. Strong Character Mix uses capital letters, digits and special characters.

4) I have tried Simple Usage: Simple Usage is fast. Simple Usage works instantly through the command line interface.

5) Lightweight and Dependency-Free: Uses only built-in Python libraries (random and string).

6) Prevents passwords: The system warns when the password is too short.
