## Problem statement
With the increasing number of online accounts, applications, and digital services, users often struggle to create strong and unique passwords. Many people reuse simple passwords, making their accounts vulnerable to hacking, brute-force attacks and data breaches. There is a need for a simple tool that can generate a safe , random and complex passwor4ds that follow strong security and reduce the risk of unauthorised access.
## Scope of the Project

a) The Password Generator is a Python tool. I use the Password Generator to make passwords. The Password Generator lets you set the length you need.
The scope covers the items listed below:

b) Generating random passwords using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

c) ensuring the users can specify the password length as per their needs.

d) Producing passwords suitable for multiple use cases like websites, applications, Wi-Fi networks, or personal data protection.

e) I am building a command line tool. The command line tool works on any device that has Python installed.

 The project focuses on simplicity, reliability and strong randomness. The project does not use UI or encryption systems.
## Target Users
 made this project for:

1) Students needing secure passwords for academic platforms or coding projects

2) General users who  want passwords to log in daily digital accounts.

3) developers who need the password generation for testing or securing.

4) I see that IT users need passwords, for the system setups. IT users rely on those passwords.

5) Anyone concerned about digital security and password strength
## High-Level Features

1) Random Password Generation: Random Password Generation gives me a password that's random and unpredictable.

2) Customizable Length: The user can set the password length. The user decides how characters the password will contain.

3) Strong Character Mix: I use Strong Character Mix which uses capital letters, digits and special characters.

4) I have tried Simple Usage: Simple Usage is fast. It works instantly through the command line interface.

5) Lightweight and Dependency-Free: Uses only built-in Python libraries (random and string).

6) Prevents passwords: The system warns when the password is too short.
